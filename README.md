smartspritesExampleApp
======================

A small example demonstrating the smartsprites-maven-plugin in use.

The example is rather straightforward so you just might want to take a look at the following files:

-          Pom.xml

o   line 23-40 for the SmartSprites part,

o   line 42-53 copy the generated ressources,

o   line 55-69 Jetty

-          Src/main/webapp/Index.jsp (divs for showing the images, line 16-21)

-          Src/main/sprites/css/flags.css (css configuration part)

The other files are just for making this example look a bit nicer.
